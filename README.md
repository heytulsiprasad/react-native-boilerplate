## An indie boilerplate of react native

I've been trying out this new framework to build mobile apps, called React Native.

It's easy to use and maintain but it's a pain to start a project as it's takes a lot of effort and documentation scrolling to get it up and running. Now there's a ton of boilerplates out there which you should be using while starting a big project but I felt they were unnecessary when you're just trying things out for the first time. So I build this, mostly to understand how things are tied up all together.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to project's root directory
3. Remove `.git` folder, `rm -rf .git`
4. Use [React Native Rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) to update project name `npx react-native-rename <newName>`
5. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
6. Run the test application:

- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android` or Use Android Studio (Recommended)
- On iOS:
  - Open `ios/YourReactProject.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device

### Disclaimer

I don't have a mac so I couldn't test if it worked on iOS devices, but provided I've used the libraries correctly (if so) they must work perfectly fine.
